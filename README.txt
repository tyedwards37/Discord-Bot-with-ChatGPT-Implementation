Project: Discord Bot w/ ChatGPT Implementation
by Tyler Edwards and David Navarro
Started October 24th, 2023

Description: A Discord bot that utilizes ChatGPT to replicate a character or person given either a detailed description or set personality by the programmer. With its current implementation, the bot will respond only when it is directly mentioned using the @ feature and will only remain running if the code is actively running. The example character is Jax from "The Amazing Digital Circus."

Language: Python

Reason: To learn how ChatGPT is implented in code, practice working with AI structures

Successes: Having worked with Discord bots, on the user experience end of things, I was able to figure out the programming side easier. 

Setbacks: Familarizing myself with and figuring out how to mesh the two APIs (ChatGPT and Discord), proved to be the one of the hardest parts of the project.

Learned: how to work with ChatGPT API, preoperly prompting an AI, how to work with Discord API
